> Dexcade?

Dexcade is a general Arcade plugin for use on the Dexoria Network exclusively.

It contains all of the games for our network and therefore all of our code for those games. We trust that the code will not be abused in any way that we perceive as such. This project is licensed under GNU's General Public License v3 (GPL v3) and a TXT file containing the license is included.

To build the plugin, you must use Maven. There are 2 ways that we usually do this.

**METHOD ONE | REQUIRES MAVEN TO BE INSTALLED:** Download the source or clone the repo. Navigate to the directory of the repo and run this into your command line: 

	mvn clean install

**METHOD TWO | REQUIRES ECLIPSE AND M2E:** Right-click on the project in your navigation panel, go to "Run as" and select the first "Maven build" option down the list. Eclipse will build the jar for you.
